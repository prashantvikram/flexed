# Flexed
A CSS flex based responsive layout system

## Getting Started

All you need to do is include the flexed.js and flexed.css files in your project.
By default, the class names for columns use an underscore (_) as a prefix. 
You can modify this by editing the classPrefix const in flexed.js (line 2).
Also, the media query is defined for '768px'. 
You can modify this by editing the breakPoint const in flexed.js (line 2)
